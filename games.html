        <h3><a target="_blank" class="head" href="https://www.lordz.io/">Lordz.io</a></h3>
        <p>Lordz.io is a multiplayer survival game based in a medieval world. Starting as a lonesome lord, you must build a small empire by collecting gold and building your base. Create various military units and prepare your defenses. Be careful out there, there are other lords to contend with! </p>
        <img class="src" src="lordz.png" alt="Image">
        <p>There are several buildings that can be used to expand your power. Build mage towers and introduce your foes to the power of magic with mages. Expand your little kingdom with houses for soldiers, knights, archers, and more powerful units. 
        A key part of the game is earning gold. You can do this by collecting coins manually. But if you want to become a wealthy lord, you build gold mines on deposits. Then you can buy all the flashy things, like fire-breathing dragons.
        You can directly attack other lords if you’re feeling brave. It’s also highly lucrative to destroy and loot their buildings when they’re away on business. If you’re sneaky, you can take down enemy gold mines for significant rewards. Then use the currency to splash out on a few dragons.</p>

            Critics praised the game when it debuted, and it took the top spot in the free apps section on the App Store and on Google Play. Some critics however, characterized the game as a clone of the 2018 independent game Donut County. It has also been criticized for being promoted as a multiplayer game when the other "players" are likely computer controlled NPC's</p>
